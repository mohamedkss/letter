  <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
  <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
  <p>Thank you for your recent applicaction to join us at the University of Awesome´s science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questios <strong>one by one</strong>, in the following sections.</p>
  
  <h2>Starting dates</h2>
  
  <p>
    We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates fir eachone are as follows:

  <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
  <p>
    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minged research facility — as long the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You <strong>seem</strong> like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our ream. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in the order of priority:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) </li>
    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&deg;C (86&deg;F), when the audicence size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
    <li><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
  <p>
    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances, To answer your question, my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:
  </p>
  
  <dl>
    <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
    <dd>A little known but <i>very</i>influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance arounf in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
    
    <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
    <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involver huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies aroung in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking</dd>
    
    <dt>Artic robot dance</dt>
    <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd>

  <p> Yours sincerely,</p>
